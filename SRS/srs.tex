\section{Operating Environment}
The IAMS will operate on multiple operating systems, including MacOS, Windows, and Linux. The system requires users to have a basic understanding of login procedures and familiarity with college administration workflows. Modern web browsers and internet connectivity are prerequisites for accessing the system.

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}

\textbf{Cross-Platform Compatibility:} The system must support various operating systems (MacOS, Windows, Linux) without performance degradation.\\
\textbf{User Authentication:} Secure authorization mechanisms (e.g., password hashing, OTP verification) must be implemented.\\
\textbf{Scalability:} The system should handle a large number of concurrent users during peak usage, such as exam schedules and result publications.\\
\textbf{Data Security:} Sensitive data, including student and faculty information, must be encrypted and securely stored.\\
\textbf{System Dependencies:} Requires a robust database system (e.g., MySQL or MongoDB) and reliable backend infrastructure using Node.js or equivalent.\\
\textbf{User Accessibility:} The interface must be intuitive and responsive across devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\textbf{Assumptions:}
    - Users will have access to stable internet connectivity.
    - College administration will provide necessary details such as course information, faculty assignments, and exam schedules.
    - Users possess basic computer literacy and familiarity with academic workflows.\\

\textbf{Dependencies:}
    - The software relies on third-party frameworks and libraries for frontend (e.g., React) and backend (e.g., Node.js).
    - External APIs may be utilized for OTP services and notifications.
    - The system is dependent on database servers for managing profiles, course data, and exam schedules.
    - Scheduled backups and maintenance are required to ensure data integrity and system availability.


\chapter{Specific Requirements}
IAMS is a software that effeciently manages the the overall college management work. Here, We discuss functional and non-functional requirements of IAMS.
\section{Functional Requirements}
We describe the functional requirements through various use cases. The features are prioritized from top to bottom.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Use Case 1: Authentication}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Primary Actor:} Admin, Faculty, Student
        \item \textbf{Precondition:} Valid ID and password exist in the system.
        \item \textbf{Main Scenario:}
        \begin{enumerate}

            \item Enters their ID and password.
            \item The system validates the credentials.
            \item Upon successful validation, the user is redirected to their dashboard.
        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Alternate Scenario:}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item If the credentials are invalid, the system displays an error message.
            \item The user is given the option to reset their password or return to the login page.
            \item If the user does not have an account, they are redirected to the signup page.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Use Case 2: Course Registration}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Primary Actor:} Student

        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Alternate Scenario:}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item If a selected course is full, the system notifies the student and provides a waitlist option.
            \item If the registration deadline has passed, the system denies access and informs the student.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}

        \end{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Alternate Scenario:}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item If mandatory fields are missing or incorrect, the system highlights the errors and prevents submission.

\chapter{Appendix}
\section{APPENDIX A: CGPA Calculation}
CGPA refers to the cumulative grade point average which translates to the total of all your credit points. This system helps in assessing the overall academic performance of a student. Although the evaluation criteria may vary from one country to another, the CGPA system is among the most common evaluation way.SGPA, which stands for Semester Grade Point Average is an evaluation method that highlights the semester-wise performance of the student. It can be calculated by simply adding all the credit points awarded for the subjects and then dividing it by the total credits allotted to that semester.Thus, by adding up all the SGPAs you have got in an academic year by the total number of semesters, you will find CGPA from SGPA.
